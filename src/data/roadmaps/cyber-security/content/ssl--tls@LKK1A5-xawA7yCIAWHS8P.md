# SSL vs TLS

What's the difference between SSL and TLS?

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a communication protocol, or set of rules, that creates a secure connection between two devices or applications on a network. It’s important to establish trust and authenticate the other party before you share credentials or data over the internet. SSL is technology your applications or browsers may have used to create a secure, encrypted communication channel over any network. However, SSL is an older technology that contains some security flaws. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the upgraded version of SSL that fixes existing SSL vulnerabilities. TLS authenticates more efficiently and continues to support encrypted communication channels.
